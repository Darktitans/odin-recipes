    <p>Making a delicious homemade pizza from scratch involves preparing the dough, a simple sauce, adding your favorite
        toppings, and baking it to golden, bubbly perfection. The key to a great crust is a slow fermentation of the
        dough, which develops a more complex flavor and better texture. While pre-made bases are available, making your
        own ensures a fresh, authentic taste.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>Dough Ingredients:</h3>
        <li>1 package active dry yeast (2 1/4 tsp)</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup warm water (105°F-115°F)</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp sea salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <h3>Sauce Ingredients:</h3>
        <li>1 can (14 oz) crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tsp Italian herbs (oregano, basil)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <h3>Toppings:</h3>
        <li>1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Your choice of vegetables (onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, olives) or protein (pepperoni, cooked sausage)
        </li>
        <li>Cornmeal for dusting the pan</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Dough: In a small bowl, stir together the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5
            minutes until it becomes foamy. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Add the foamy yeast
            mixture and olive oil, then mix and knead until a smooth, soft, slightly tacky dough forms.</li>
        <li>Let it Rise: Brush a large bowl with olive oil, place the dough inside, and turn to coat. Cover the bowl
            with plastic wrap or a damp cloth and set it aside in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size
            (about 1 to 1.5 hours).</li>
        <li>
            Prepare Oven and Toppings: Preheat your oven to its highest setting (around 475°F or 245°C) with a pizza
            stone or heavy baking sheet inside for at least 30 minutes. Prepare all your toppings and bring them to room
            temperature to prevent a soggy pizza.
        </li>
        <li>
            Assemble the Pizza: Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Stretch or roll it
            into a round shape, leaving a slightly thicker edge for the crust. Transfer the base to a pizza peel or
            baking sheet dusted with cornmeal. Spread sauce evenly over the base, add cheese, and then your desired
            toppings.
        </li>
        <li>Bake: Slide the pizza into the preheated oven and bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the crust is golden
            brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
    </ol>
