    <p>Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish centered around specially prepared vinegared rice (sushi-meshi), combined
        with various ingredients (called neta), such as raw seafood, vegetables, or sometimes cooked items. The key is
        the unique short-grain, starchy rice, seasoned with a mixture of rice vinegar, sugar, and salt, which gives it a
        distinct flavor and sticky texture that holds its shape well. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 cups uncooked Japanese short-grain white rice</li>
        <li>1.5 cups water</li>
        <li>4 tbsp rice vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <h3>For the Rolls:</h3>
        <li>Nori sheets (dried seaweed)</li>
        <li>Imitation crabmeat, flaked</li>
        <li>Avocado, sliced into strips</li>
        <li>Cucumber, cut into thin strips</li>
        <li>Optional: Mayonnaise, sesame seeds, pickled ginger, wasabi, soy sauce for serving </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Rice: Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear, then cook with water in a rice
            cooker or pot. Once cooked, transfer the hot rice to a large shallow bowl. In a separate small bowl,
            dissolve the sugar and salt in the rice vinegar over low heat, then pour the mixture over the hot rice.
            Gently fold the seasoning into the rice using a "slicing" motion with a paddle and fan it to cool it
            quickly, which helps it shine and prevents it from becoming mushy.</li>
        <li>Assemble the Roll: Place one sheet of nori, shiny side down, on a bamboo sushi mat (often wrapped in plastic
            wrap to prevent sticking). With wet hands, spread a thin, even layer of rice over the nori, leaving about a
            1-inch border at the top edge.</li>
        <li>Add Fillings: Arrange your chosen fillings (e.g., crab, avocado, cucumber) in a line horizontally across the
            rice, near the bottom edge closest to you. Be careful not to overfill.</li>
        <li>Roll Tightly: Using the bamboo mat to guide you, lift the edge closest to you and roll tightly over the
            ingredients, applying even pressure. Moisten the uncovered nori border with a little water to seal the roll.
        </li>
        <li>Slice and Serve: Use a very sharp, wet knife to cut the roll into 6-8 pieces, wiping the blade with a damp
            cloth between cuts. Serve immediately with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger. </li>
    </ol>
