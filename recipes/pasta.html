    <p>To prepare a simple yet delicious pasta dish, begin by bringing a large pot of generously salted water to a
        rolling boil and cooking your choice of dried pasta, such as penne or spaghetti, until it is al dente, or "firm
        to the bite". Before draining the pasta, be sure to reserve about a cup of the starchy pasta water, as this is
        the key to creating a silky and cohesive sauce that clings to the noodles. In a separate large skillet, heat
        some olive oil and sauté minced garlic and red pepper flakes until fragrant, then add your choice of sauce
        base—whether it be a quick tomato puree, a rich cream, or just a little butter. Finally, add the cooked pasta
        and a splash of the reserved pasta water directly to the skillet, tossing everything together vigorously over
        low heat until the sauce emulsifies and evenly coats every piece, then finish with fresh parsley or grated
        Parmesan cheese for a quick and satisfying meal.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li> large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li> cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li> (28-ounce) cans crushed tomatoes in puree</li>
        <li> teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li> teaspoon dried basil (or 3-4 fresh leaves)</li>
        <li> teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li> Pinch of red pepper flakes</li>
        <li> Black pepper, to taste </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sauté aromatics: Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook
            until softened and translucent, about 5-7 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until
            fragrant, being careful not to let it brown.</li>
        <li>Add tomatoes and seasonings: Pour in the crushed tomatoes, dried oregano, dried basil, and red pepper flakes
            (if using). Stir in the salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Simmer the sauce: Bring the sauce to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Let it simmer, uncovered,
            for at least 20 minutes, or until slightly thickened. Stir occasionally.</li>
        <li>Cook pasta: While the sauce is simmering, cook your desired pasta according to package directions in a pot
            of salted boiling water. Reserve about a cup of the starchy pasta water before draining.</li>
        <li>Combine and serve: Add the cooked pasta directly to the sauce. Add a splash of the reserved pasta water to
            help the sauce coat the pasta and achieve a smooth consistency. Toss well to combine. Serve hot, optionally
            with grated cheese. </li>
    </ol>
